This tool is a client library for the Asterisk REST API, which will be
available in Asterisk 12 and later. Direct questions and comments to Erin
Spiceland at espiceland@digium.com.

Errata

* The Asterisk REST API provided by res_stasis_http is not currently fully
implemented in Asterisk. Therefore, the modules created by this tool will
not actually do anything yet. Because of this, some statements in the
module are ineffective, resulting in low pylint scores.
* Support for greater resultion of class and method templating is needed.
* The return values of methods is not currently gleaned from the Swagger
resource files. This will be implemented in the future.

Developer Guidelines

All code, including code which is generated by the tool, should conform to
pep8 and should attain a relatively high pylint score.
