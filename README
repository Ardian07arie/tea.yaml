This tool is a client library for the Asterisk REST API, which will be
available in Asterisk 12 and later. Direct questions and comments to Erin
Spiceland at espiceland@digium.com.

Errata

* The Asterisk REST API provided by res_stasis_http is not currently fully
implemented in Asterisk. Therefore, the modules created by this tool will
not actually do anything yet. Because of this, some statements in the
module are ineffective, resulting in low pylint scores.
* Support for greater resolution of class and method templating may be needed.
* The return values of methods is not currently gleaned from the Swagger
resource files. This will be implemented in the future.

Developer Guidelines

All code, including code which is part of or generated by the tool should
conform to pep8 and reasonably pass lint tools for the respective language.

If pylint gives you the error "F: 23,0: Unable to import 'api'" along with
unusually low scores, you need to add the 'lib' and 'python/lib' directories
to your PYTHONPATH.
